The goal of RmecabKo is to parse Korean phrases with `mecab-ko` ([Eunjeon project](http://eunjeon.blogspot.com/), and to provide helper functions to analyze Korean documents. RmecabKo provides R wrapper function of `mecab-ko` with `Rcpp` (in Mac OSX and Linux) or wrapper function of binary build of `mecab-ko-msvc` by system commands and file I/O (in Windows).

For instructions in Korean, refer to [readme.rmd](https://github.com/junhewk/RmecabKo/blob/master/readme.rmd).

## Installation

### Mac OSX, Linux

First, install `mecab-ko` from the [Bitbucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/eunjeon/mecab-ko).

You can download a source of `mecab-ko` from [Download page](https://bitbucket.org/eunjeon/mecab-ko/downloads/).

In Mac OSX terminal:

```
$ tar zxfv mecab-ko-XX.tar.gz
$ cd mecab-ko-XX
$ ./configure 
$ make
$ make check
$ sudo make install
```

In Linux:

```
$ tar zxfv mecab-ko-XX.tar.gz
$ cd mecab-ko-XX
$ ./configure 
$ make
$ make check
$ su
# make install
```

After the installation of `mecab-ko`, You can install RmecabKo from github with:

```
install.packages("RmecabKo")
# or, install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("junhewk/RmecabKo")
```

You need to install `mecab-ko-dic` also. (In Github version, `install_dic` function is added to support this functionality. You can install `mecab-ko-dic` with `install_dic()`. I'm working with custom dictionary function, for it `mecab-ko-dic` has to be installed by this function.) Otherwise, refer to [Bitbucket page](https://bitbucket.org/eunjeon/mecab-ko-dic). The installation procedure is same as `mecab-ko`.

### Windows

In Windows, `install_mecab` function is provided. You need to specify the installation path of the `mecab-ko` and `meccab-ko-dic` in the function parameter, `mecabLocation`.

```
install.packages("RmecabKo")
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("junhewk/RmecabKo")
install_mecab("D:/Rlibs/mecab")
```


## Example

Basic usage of the provided functions is to put character vector in `phrase` parameter of `pos(phrase)` and `nouns(phrase)`. Loop between phrases are operated in the C++ binary, thus you can analyze many phrases quickly.

```
pos("Hello. This is R wrapper of Korean morpheme analyzer mecab-ko.")
```

Output of the `pos` is list. Each element of the list contains classified morpheme and inferred part-of-speech (POS), separated by "/". The name of the element is the original phrase.

Output of the `nouns` is also list. Each element of the list contains extracted nouns. The name of the element is the original phrase.

`tokenizer` functions are added. You can use `tokens_morph`, `tokens_words`, `tokens_nouns`, and `tokens_ngram`. Please refer to the help page of each function.

`stopwords_ko` data frame is added. It contains Korean stop morphemes, based on the scraped sentences. The list of the Korean stop words will be updated continually.

More examples will be provided on [Github wiki](https://github.com/junhewk/RmecabKo/wiki).
